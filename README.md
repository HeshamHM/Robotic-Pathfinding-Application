# Robotic Pathfinding Application

## Overview

The Robotic Pathfinding Application is a 2D grid-based program designed to find the shortest path for a robot to navigate from a random start point to an endpoint while avoiding immovable obstacles (blocks). The main goal of this application is to implement efficient pathfinding algorithms to solve this problem.

## Features

- Generation:
  - The application generates a 20*20 with a random robot's starting position, an endpoint, and immovable blocks.
  
- Pathfinding Algorithms:
  - Implements various pathfinding algorithm Breadth-First Search, to find the shortest path from start to end while avoiding obstacles.
  
- Visualization:
  - Provides a visual representation of the grid, displaying the robot's path and the obstacles.
  
- User Interaction:
  - Allows users to interact with the grid, specifying endpoint, and blocking/unblocking cells.
